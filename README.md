# OracleSQLWork-Spring2016-DatabaseOrganization
A collection of some of the work I completed for my Database Organization class at the Illinois Institute of Technology using the Oracle SQL Developer environment.

The FinalProject folder contains all the files for the simple Oracle SQL DB-backed PHP website that I created, all of that work is mine alone, as my group members could not / did not contribute to the actual code for that assignment.
