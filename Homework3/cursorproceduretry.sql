4. When the user inputs a studentâ€™s name, he should view all the details that are marked public.
This procedure only takes into account a single account_visible variable in a given person's profile. 
In the actual database, each individual attribute on each person's profile would need its own _visible variable, and 
Get_Public_Attributes would have to loop through the entire profile, find the variables marked with _Visible, see if they are set to 'True', 
and then save / output the variable that they correspond to if they are true.*/
